## What I learned

This challenge helped me learn and understand more about Web scraping. I also learned how to scrape data from websites using Nodejs and Puppeteer. I also learned how to make use of the [Bright Data Scraping Browser](https://brightdata.com/products/scraping-browser) which helps simulate a real browser, making the scraping process a lot more easier.
